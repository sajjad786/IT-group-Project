<strong>The Department of Marketing & International Business at Hofstra University</strong> teaches marketing students how to better understand consumer behavior from multiple perspectives, including demographic, social, economic, cultural and technological. We are located just 25 miles from the major global business capital of New York City, which means our students have opportunities for networking and internships at some of the largest, most successful companies in the world. And those opportunities pay off: The department’s Master of Science in Marketing program was ranked 20th in the nation by TFE Times and top 35 by College Choice. Hofstra is ranked in top 21 percent nationwide among Best Schools for Marketing Careers, based on the 20-year return on investment of graduates with a bachelor’s degree, according to the 2015-16 PayScale College ROI Report.
